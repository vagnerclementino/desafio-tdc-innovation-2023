# TDC Innovation 2023 Challenge

Welcome to our API Gateway challenge proposed at [TDC
Innovation](https://thedevconf.com/tdc/2023/innovation/)! In this challenge, you
will have the opportunity to explore Hotmart Developers, a public API hub managed
managed by [Hotmart](https://hotmart.com). The API platform is
available at
[developers.hotmart.com](https://developers.hotmart.com).

Before participating in the challenge, you must create an account at Hotmart, if
you do not already have one. At
[home page](https://developers.hotmart.com/docs/pt-BR/start/about/) you will find all the
details on how to get started on the platform. After creating your account, you will have to
generate a credential and make a request to **any** read endpoint (`GET`) of our platform, e.g. "Sales History", "Sales Summary", "Get Subscriptions" and receive a success result (`status code 200`).

After performing the request, your task is to send an e-mail to
[vagner.clementino@hotmart.com](mailto:vagner.clementino@hotmart.com) with the
with the contents of the payload returned from the endpoint. We will validate the receipt of requests from the platform's own logs. The first three participants who send an e-mail will receive a personalized kit and a discount to the
Hot 'N Code Conference] event (<http://hotm.art/hnc-2023?src=2088&utm_source=2088>).

Don't waste time! Go to
[developers.hotmart.com](https://developers.hotmart.com), create your account, make a request
an application and send the e-mail with the requested information. Good luck!
