## Challenge

Welcome to the challenge proposed in the TDC Innovation event! In this
challenge, you will have the opportunity to explore Hotmart Developers, a
public API hub provided by Hotmart Company. You can access this platform at
[developer.hotmart.com](developer.hotmart.com).

Before participating in the challenge, you need to create an account on Hotmart
if you don't have one yet. Once you have initiated your account, you should
create a credential and request a specific endpoint. This endpoint will return
the number of people involved in the TDC Innovation edition.

After obtaining this information, your task will be to send an email to
vagner.clementino@hotmart.com with the payload of the endpoint. Your requests
will be validated in the Hotmart Developers logs. The first three participants
to send the correct requests will receive a customized kit as a prize.

Don't waste any time! Visit [developer.hotmart.com](developer.hotmart.com),
create your account, request your endpoint, and send the email with the
requested information. Good luck!
