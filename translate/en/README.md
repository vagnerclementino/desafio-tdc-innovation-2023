# TDC Innovation 2023 Challenge

Welcome to our API Gateway challenge proposed at [TDC
Innovation](https://thedevconf.com/tdc/2023/innovation/)! In this challenge, you
will have the opportunity to explore Hotmart Developers, a public API hub managed
managed by [Hotmart](https://hotmart.com). The API platform is
available at
[developers.hotmart.com](https://developers.hotmart.com).

Before participating in the challenge, you must create an account at Hotmart, if
you do not already have one. At that
[page](https://developers.hotmart.com/docs/en/start/about/) you have all the
details on how to get started on the platform. After you start your account, you will have to
create a credential and make a request to **any** read endpoint (`GET`) our platform, e.g. "Sales History", "Sales Summary", "Get Subscriptions". Possibly the endpoints
have not returned data, the important thing is that you receive a successful result (status code 200).

After making the request, your task is to send an e-mail to
[vagner.clementino@hotmart.com](mailto:vagner.clementino@hotmart.com) with the
content of the payload returned by the endpoint and the email address used to register. Your requests will be validated in the platform's own
platform's own logs. The first three participants to send the payload
(payload) of the request will receive a personalized kit and a discount for the
Hot 'N Code Conference] event (<http://hotm.art/hnc-2023?src=2088&utm_source=2088>).

Don't waste time! Go to
[developers.hotmart.com](https://developers.hotmart.com), create your account, place
and send the email with the requested information.
